                <p class=card-body>At the beginning of the year, I was going through a very rough patch due to my parents going through a divorce. I had a lot of pent up anger and I was acting out a lot in school and going off on people who were trying to be there for me during that time. One time when I felt completely out of control in relation to my emotions, I did what almost every teenager does these days when they are faced with issues, consulted the internet. I'm actually glad I did though. This self-care webpage popped up and I decided, why not just give it a shot. The quotes were helpful and encouraging. After filling in the questionnaire, I was advised to get a journal and see a therapist if possible. That advice really helped me and I've come quite a long way, for which I am glad.</p>

                <p class="card-body">For the longest time, I have been a fan of my own company. Kind of introverted but like introverted on steroids. Preferring my own company, I really wasn't doing the best in well preserving the few personal relationships I had. In the few social gatherings I would be dragged to, I would always be completely quiet and literally put in my earphones so that I'm not approached. I also barely trusted anyone, even those kind enough to call me a friend despite my ridiculous communication and interaction skills. Surfing through the internet once, I found this self-care webpage. I was able to gather quite helpful information, and apply it to my social life. When I fill in the questionnaire now, I score quite highly in the social self-care section, contrary to before. I have improved in general self-care as well. My friends and family have noted a positive change in my social behaviour, and though still an introvert, it is not as extreme as before. I really have learnt the importance of balanced social interaction, humans are social beings after all.</p>

                <p class="card-body">You know those people who are always like "I really need to get in shape!!" then maybe on that one day when they feel extra motivated they go ahead and do just that, then after that it's like 100 years before they think about exercise? That's me, I'm people lol. Anyway, so one day I ate like a large pizza by myself and I was like, "Man, I really gotta work that off." I was not feeling particularly motivated though. So, I decided to search online for 'motivation to exercise' quotes or websites or whatever. So, this self-care webpage popped up, and I saw some encouraging quotes. I then filled in the questionnaire, and my score on physical self-care was not that great. For some reason, that challenged me, and I decided that every week I'd be filling in the questionnaire, and I would want to see a good score in general, and especially in the physical self-care part. This site has helped me keep track weekly on how bad or good I'm doing in terms of exercise, and those results challenge me to do better.</p>
