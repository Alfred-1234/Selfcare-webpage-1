                <p class=card-body>At the beginning of the year, I was going through a very rough patch due to my parents going through a divorce. I had a lot of pent up anger and I was acting out a lot in school and going off on people who were trying to be there for me during that time. One time when I felt completely out of control in relation to my emotions, I did what almost every teenager does these days when they are faced with issues, consulted the internet. I'm actually glad I did though. This selfcare webpage popped up and I decided, why not just give it a shot. The quotes were helpful and encouraging. After filling in the questionnaire, I was advised to get a journal and see a therapist if possible. That advice really helped me and I've come quite a long way, for which I am glad.</p>
